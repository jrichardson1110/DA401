# City Subway Design

This project provides the functions needed to create an optimized subway route through any city in the United States for which there is data available representing the total population broken down by census block. Currently, it completes that process for Columbus, Ohio, and Cleveland, Ohio. There are also functions to validate the process against cities that already have small rail networks - currently, that process is only executed for Cleveland.

### Data

Geodata for all census blocks was too large of a dataset to load in GitHub - can be found at https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/fedmaps::u-s-census-blocks-1/about.

The ColumbusCensusBlocksPopulations dataset contains block-by-block populations for the Columbus metropolitan area.
